# Integer to Ordinal Words

## WARNING! This repo is under dev and should not be used in a production application.

Converts integer to string, and returns the ordinal value.

```
DigitsToWords(101) = "one hundred and tenth"
DigitsToWords(1111) = "one thousand one hundred and eleventh"
```
## Getting Started

Currently only works for numbers between 1 to 10000.
